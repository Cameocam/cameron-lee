I'm Cameron, an aspiring business analyst with experience on 5 technical projects at TripleTen. While at TripleTen, I have been fine tuning my skills in business analytics, data visualization, SQL, and storytelling. My other skills that I have a acquired over the years are customer service, sales, problem-solving, and self motivation.

Currently, I am working towards landing a position with a company to put my newly acquired skills in business analytics. I am still currently honing my skills with TripleTen's 4-month Business Intelligence Analyst program. The course covered Advanced Spreadsheets, Data Collection and Storage (SQL), Business Analytics, Data Visualization with Tableau, Storytelling with Data, and Power BI. These courses involved numerous practical projects.

While still on my learning journey, I am going to participate in an externship program. Stay tuned for those projects in my repositories!

Some fun facts about me:
- I used to be a radio DJ for a local radio station.
- I used to be a correspondent on TMZ.
- I enjoy reading comic books and watching action, sci-fi, and thriller movies.
- I love going to the boxing gym.
- My goals for  2024: landing a job in business analytics. Also, making it back to Japan!
